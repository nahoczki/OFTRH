    "\n",
    "Finding quality healthcare is important. The goal of this project is to provide patients with listings of top- rated hospitals near them, so they are provided with timely and quality care. With this information, another goal of this project is to attempt to explain reasoning for the such hospital ratings by comparing crime rates in the same areas. We hypothesize areas with higher crime rates will have lower funded hospitals and will therefore have lower hospital ratings and areas with lower crime rates will have better funded hospitals and therefore higher quality hospital ratings. To accomplish this, we will use the Hospital General Information data set available at this [site](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/hospitals) and extract the hospital ratings data for each state. The data provides key information on hospitals in the US including their name, state, rating and type of hospital ownership (government, proprietary, voluntary (non-profit), etc.). To determine the correlation(s) between hospital ratings and crime rates we will use the crime rate dataset from this [site](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/crime-rate-by-state)."
